Sets can't contain duplicates
Sets are unordered  €Ì— „— »Â
In order to find an element in a set, a hash lookup is used (which is why sets are unordered). This makes __contains__ (in operator) a lot more efficient for sets than lists.
Sets can only contain hashable items (see #3). If you try: set(([1],[2])) you'll get a TypeError.
